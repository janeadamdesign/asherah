## Mediterranean Restaurant

Brochure website for a contemporary Mediterranean restaurant. There are five core pages: a landing page with contact details; an exploratory page which narrativises and illustrates the biography of the founder and history of the restaurant; a gallery consisting of customer-contributed unposed photographs; a page containing a UI through which end-users can secure restaurant reservations with dynamic generation of timeslots on the basis of availability.

All images generated with Midjourney.
